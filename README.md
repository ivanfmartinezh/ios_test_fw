## Introduction

Proton Mail iOS client for encrypted email.

The application contains the following features among others (some are only available to paid users): create new accounts, sign in to multiple accounts, read and compose emails, schedule emails to be sent at a specific time, protect emails with a password, set emails expiration time, organise emails with labels and folders, manage contacts, change account settings, and many more...

Currently the application supports iOS version 11 and above

## Project setup

1. As a first step, you have to have macOS up to date and install Xcode 14+

2. The project uses [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint) as a package manager. If you don't have it installed, you can do it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by `brew bundle --file="ProtonMail/Brewfile" --no-upgrade`. Once you have it ready, in order to install dependecies run:

`mint bootstrap`

3. [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) and Cocoapods are pre-downloaded. We are using git submodules for tracking DOMPurifier. After cloning the repository run these two commands:  

`git submodule init`
`git submodule update`

4. We are using [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to generate Xcode project. To create the corresponding project files run: 

`sh ProtonMail/xcodeGenHelper.sh`

## Running Proton Mail

1. In order to run the project you will need first to set your own provisioning profile. You can do that in the `Signing & Capabilities` settings of the `ProtonMail` target.

2. For development purposes we have Core Data's concurrency flag enabled. That could occasionaly crash the application. If you want to disable the flag, go to the `ProtonMail` scheme and uncheck the laujnch argument `-com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1`
